    <p class="done"><span style="font-size:35; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold;">Jenny Kim</span> is my old friend who volunteers in Youumbba Dog Shelter at Seoul, South Korea.
    <br> Jenny has been volunteering in Dog Shelter for 2 years now.<a href="http://www.instagram.com/youumbba/">(Youumbba Animal Shelter)</a>
    <br> I chose to interview Jenny because I have a lot of interest in abandoned or rescued dogs.
    <br> I also went to the shelter twice when I went to Korea during summer vacation.
    <br>Below is the interview with Jenny.</p>
    <br>

    <p><strong id="names">Me:</strong> Hi Jenny, I contacted you because I was curious about the dog shelter where you volunteer.</p>
    <p><strong id="names">Jenny:</strong> Hi Tina, I'm glad that you are interested about the dog shelter. I'll tell you as much as I can.</p>
    <p><strong id="names">Me:</strong> I heard you've been working in a shelter for two years, right?</p>
    <p><strong id="names">Jenny:</strong> Yeah, I've been volunteering at Youumbba shelter twice a month for two years.</p>
    <p class="questions"><strong id="names">Me:</strong> For those who are not friendly about the dog shelter, could you explain what the dog shelter is? </p>
    <p><strong id="names">Jenny:</strong> The dog shelter is a space where it protects abandoned and rescued dogs.</p>
    <p>Dogs in the shelter go back to their homes or they are adopted by new owners.</p>
    <p class="questions"><strong id="names">Me:</strong> What do you usually do there?
    <p><strong id="names">Jenny:</strong> I usually clean the inside of the cages, feed dogs, wash dogs, and sometimes I assist people who come to groom dogs.</p>
    <p><strong id="names">Me:</strong> You do a lot more than I thought. Very surprising.</p>
    <p><strong id="names">Jenny:</strong> Yes, once I go to the shelter, I work from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. and the time passes so fast that I don't even know how it went.</p>
    <p><strong id="names">Me:</strong> I'm sure so.</p>
    <p><span class="questions">How many dogs are there in the dog shelter?</span></p>
    <br>

    <h2>"More than 500 abandoned and rescued dogs"</h2>
    <img src="images/dogs shelter.jpg" alt=""> <img src="images/dogs shelter2.jpg" alt="">
    <h5 class="subject">An average of 260 dogs a day and 100,000 dogs a year are are abandoned in South Korea."</h5>
    <br>
    <p><strong id="names">Jenny:</strong> There are about 500 dogs in the dog shelter where I work.<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+dogs+are+in+the+shelter&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS758US759&oq=how+many+dogs+in+the+shelter+&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.16020j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">(Number of Dogs in the Shelter)</a></p>
    <p><strong id="names">Me:</strong> 500? I can't believe there are so many homeless dogs.</p>
    <p class="questions">Do you know what stories the dogs in the dog shelter usually have?</p>
    <p><strong id="names">Jenny:</strong> There are so many dogs coming to the shelters for so many different reasons.</p>
    <p>Some are abandoned by their owners and rescued from the streets, while others are rescued from puppy mills or slaughterhouses.</p>
    <p><strong id="names">Me:</strong> I think there are a lot of people who aren't really human.</p>
    <p><strong id="names">Jenny:</strong> That's right. It's impossible to abandon a living life like that.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>"Dogs that are not adopted get euthanized"</h2>
    <p class="questions"><strong id="names">Me:</strong> How do the dogs at the shelter find new homes?</p>
    <p><strong id="names">Jenny:</strong> Usually, dogs in shelters are put up for adoptions on sites like Instagram and Facebook.</p>
    <p>Those who come to see the dogs will have to fill out an application and then follow some procedures before they can adopt.</p>
    <p>We also send dogs not only in Korea but also abroad. Mixed dogs, which are not pure breeds, have many difficulties in being adopted in Korea.</p>
    <p>This is because many Koreans prefer small and pretty puppies. Therefore, many dogs are adopted to foreign countries such as U.S. and Europe</p>
    <p>where there are no preconceptions about the mixed breeds.</p>
    <br>

    <h5 class="subject">"Dogs adopted from Youumbba Shelter"</h5>
    <br>
    <p class="questions"><strong id="names">Me:</strong> Then what about dogs that are not adopted for a certain time?</p>
    <p><strong id="names">Jenny:</strong> This is a very sad part, but dogs that have not been able to find their new homes for a month are unfortunately euthanized.</p>
    <p>And this is because dozens of dogs come into the shelter every day and the shelter need to keep the numbers of dogs we can keep.</p>
    <p><strong id="names">Me:</strong> What a sad reality. Of course, not all dogs will be adopted in a month.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>"Donations run the Shelter!"</h2>
    <p class="questions">How does the dog shelter work?</p>
    <p>It's a lot of money spent on dogs and nothing comes back to benefits for the shelter?</p>
    <p><strong id="names">Jenny:</strong> The shelters run with donations. Many people donate a lot every month and many celebrities also make a lot of donations!</p>
    <p>There are various ways of donating. You can donate money itself, and sometimes the price of purchasing our designed goods can also be donation.</p>
    <p>The donation covers food prices, water prices, and electricity prices for dogs.</p>
    <p>And there are many volunteers like me, so there are always people waiting to work for dogs.<a href="https://earth911.com/home-garden/10-items-to-donate-to-animal-shelters/">(Donation List)</a></p>

    <br>
    <p><strong id="names">Me:</strong> There are also so many good people in the world! So my last question is, <span class="questions">why are you volunteering at the dog shelter?</span></p>
    <p><strong id="names">Jenny:</strong> I became interested in the dog shelter because of my dog.</p>
    <p> Few years ago, when I was searching for dog supplies, I found out about the abandoned dogs.</p>
    <p> I was very surprised that hundreds of dogs are abandoned per day.</p>
    <p> Looking at the pictures of dogs posted at the dog shelter website, I was depressed to see so many dogs similar to my dog.</p>
    <p> When I saw the shelters in poor environment due to lack of hands, I felt like I wanted to help.</p>
    <p> And when I was searching the Internet, I found out a large-scale dog shelter called Youumbba.</p>
    <p><strong id="names">Me:</strong> My question ends here. <span class="questions"> Do you have anything you want to say to those who want to volunteer?</span></p>
    <p><strong id="names">Jenny:</strong> Not only Youumbba, almost every dog shelters are practically run by volunteers.</p>
    <p>Therefore, I hope many volunteers who love dogs come and spend time with them and help create a pleasant environment for them.</p>
    <p><strong id="names">Me:</strong> I hope so too! Thank you so much for allowing me to interview today.</p>
    <p><strong id="names">Jenny:</strong> No problem! Thanks for being interested in the dog shelter. If you have any more questions, you can ask me anytime!</p>
