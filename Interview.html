  <h1>A Body of Knowledge: Interview</h1>
    <p style="font-family:Courier">For the assignment, I interviewed my friend, Jenny Kim, who volunteers in Dog Shelter at Seoul, South Korea.</p>
    <p style="font-family:Courier">Jenny currently lives in South Korea and she has been volunteering in Dog Shelter for 2 years now.<a href="http://www.instagram.com/youumbba/">(Youumbba Animal Shelter)</a></p>
    <p style="font-family:Courier">I chose to interview Jenny because I have a lot of interest in abandoned or rescued dogs.</p>
    <p style="font-family:Courier">I also went to the shelter twice when I went to Korea during summer vacation. Below is the interview excerpt with Jenny.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Me:</strong> Hi Jenny, I contacted you because I was curious about the dog shelter where you volunteer.</p>
    <p><strong>Jenny:</strong> Hi Tina, I'm glad that you are interested about the dog shelter. I'll tell you as much as I can.</p>
    <p><strong>Me:</strong> I heard you've been working in a shelter for two years, right?</p>
    <p><strong>Jenny:</strong> Yeah, I've been doing it twice a month for two years.</p>
    <p><strong>Me:</strong> What do you usually do there?</p>
    <p><strong>Jenny:</strong> I usually clean the inside of the cages, feed dogs, wash dogs, and sometimes I assist people who come to groom dogs.</p>
    <p><strong>Me:</strong> You do a lot more than I thought. Very surprising.</p>
    <p><strong>Jenny:</strong> Yes, once I go to the shelter, I work from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. and the time passes so fast that I don't even know how it went.</p>
    <p><strong>Me:</strong> I'm sure so. How many dogs are there in the dog shelter?</p>
    <p><strong>Jenny:</strong> There are about 500 dogs in the dog shelter where I work.<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+dogs+are+in+the+shelter&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS758US759&oq=how+many+dogs+in+the+shelter+&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.16020j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">(Number of Dogs in the Shelter)</a></p>
    <p><strong>Me:</strong> 500? I can't believe there are so many homeless dogs. Do you know what stories the dogs in the dog shelter usually have?</p>
    <p><strong>Jenny:</strong> There are so many dogs coming to the shelters for so many different reasons.</p>
    <p>Some are abandoned by their owners and rescued from the streets, while others are rescued from puppy mills or slaughterhouses.</p>
    <p><strong>Me:</strong> I think there are a lot of people who aren't really human.</p>
    <p><strong>Jenny:</strong> That's right. It's impossible to abandon a living life like that.</p>
    <p><strong>Me:</strong> How do the dogs at the shelter find new homes?</p>
    <p><strong>Jenny:</strong> Usually, dogs in shelters are put up for adoptions on sites like Instagram and Facebook.</p>
    <p>Those who come to see the dogs will have to fill out an application and then follow some procedures before they can adopt.</p>
    <p><strong>Me:</strong> Then what about dogs that are not adopted for a certain time?</p>
    <p><strong>Jenny:</strong> This is a very sad part, but dogs that have not been able to find their new homes for a month are unfortunately euthanized.</p>
    <p>And this is because dozens of dogs come into the shelter every day and the shelter need to keep the numbers of dogs we can keep.</p>
    <p><strong>Me:</strong> What a sad reality. Of course, not all dogs will be adopted in a month.</p>
    <p>So, the last question! How does the dog shelter work?</p>
    <p>It's a lot of money spent on dogs and nothing comes back to benefits for the shelter?</p>
    <p><strong>Jenny:</strong> The shelters run with donations. Many people donate a lot every month and many celebrities also make a lot of donations!</p>
    <p>The donation covers food prices, water prices, and electricity prices for dogs.</p>
    <p>And there are many volunteers like me, so there are always people waiting to work for dogs.<a href="https://earth911.com/home-garden/10-items-to-donate-to-animal-shelters/">(Donation List)</a></p>
    <p><strong>Me:</strong> There are also so many good people in the world! My question ends here. Thank you so much for allowing me to interview today.</p>
    <p><strong>Jenny:</strong> No problem! Thanks for being interested in the dog shelter. If you have any more questions, you can ask me anytime!</p>
